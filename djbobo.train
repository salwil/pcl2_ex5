i 'll be waiting here for you
do n't you feel the same way , too
i 'll be waiting for the rest of my life
hold on to what you 've got and take my hand
the more we talk the less we understand
the time we shared just seemed to go nowhere
go nowhere - nowhere
it was the first of july , when i realised , why
while i was walking through the rain
watching raindrops play their game
seventeen , seventeen years of pain
i could n't see , just could n't see my inner flame
from that day on , sudden i did n't feel alone ,
took all my courage and my pride , i gave myself a ride
beauty , only comes from deep inside ,
i stopped playing with my feelings seek and hide
my great longing in life , was to find that special wife
and everytime one came around ,
i hurt her feelings and i found
out , - it 's all about give and take
last one i did , but the first one was a fake
honesty was , what i did n't know about
and finally i met the one
that 's when i started her to show
love , - is n't it a compromise
i almost paid the highest price
come back to what you 've got and take my hand
i 'm your passion , i 'm your fortune , i 'm your friend
how can broken hearts just find their way back home
way back home - again
i 'm living a dream and here is the truth
'cause i realized i was waiting for you
i 'm living a dream and holding your hand
i look in your eyes hope this love never ends
wohohoh wohoh
you 're the colour of my dreams , the best of my life
wohohoh wohoh
you 're my daylight in the night and with you i 'm alive
you 're my lady - unique like a melody
my best discovery eternally
l - o - v - e , you made it brighter
so that i could see - reality
i guide you through the darkness of the night
alright - i protect you , hold you so i wan na tell you
right here and now that you 're the only one
and this is true , so true
i feel your love , let me be your destiny
now and eternally , you can count on me
'cause you got the key to my heart
we 'll never part , 'till the end of our days
i 'll pray that you stay by my side all the time
let the sun shine and be mine
no one else could ever take your place
your sweet embrace
i 'm living a dream now baby
'cause i realized i was waiting for you
i 'm living a dream now baby
i look in your eyes hope this love never ends
you can keep the fire burning and you make me believe
this dream is everything i need
you can keep the fire burning , it 's your love i recieve
so listen to your heart , listen to your heart and dream
i 'll never let you down
our love is indestructible
i 'll make your world go round
when you 're sad , when you 're down
when you cry i wan na bring back the sun
when you talk , when you smile
i just know you are the only one
your so precious - so perfect in my eyes
when i 'm with you , time flies
away - can you hear me what i say
today is the day , do n't runaway
come with me - and let me take you by the hand
before i 've got to go , try to understand
i 'll pray , everyday ,
our love , will never go away
let me tell you it 's true - heaven sent you to me
you 're my queen of hearts , you ' re my destiny
l-o-v-e - you put a spell on me
one thousand degrees is the heat in my
soul - you took my self-control
my mind is wild , rolling up and down the hill
like a waterfall
my love is , indestructible
let me touch you , hold you , that 's all i wan na do
i 'm electrified by you
like thunder - and lightning is a mystery
basically you took my breath - you 're my fantasy
true all i need is you
everything you say will stay , today
play the game of everlasting dreams like
in a movie scene !
do n't believe you are the best of all times
do n't forget where you 're from
when your fortune is gone
you wake up , lived a dream
you 're not invincible
no way success is on place one , not two
nothing else counts it seems to be true
no clue what you do , better help yourself
it 's all about money , no one cares about you
here one day , gone one night
you see people twice in your life and they bite not quite
alright , but there might be a fight
never forget what 's wrong , what 's right
sometimes you forget
fame is just a gift , take it day by day
sometimes you forget
you 're living in a world , heading far away
do n't fly to high , the landing is tough enough
to rough for you , come back to reality
madness , to believe you 're the hero
grow up , show up , time for you to wake up
the road is going down the other side of the hill
keep your feet on the ground - do n't kill but
chill - with all due modesty
nobody 's perfect , do n't you agree
one day you 're up , one day you 're down
seems like a kingdom but there is no crown
today you are in , tomorrow you 're out
there 's no need to cry , there 's no need to shout
i am dreaming in the sunshine
i dream of all the people i talked to in my
lifetime
different cultures , different nations
happy people , lucky people feeling my vibrations
they just told me all the reasons
i have to find my own way , do n't change it like
the season
it 's my life , i live it on my own
welcome to dangerzone
it 's my life
i stand it all alone
accept my way of living
i live it on my own
it 's my life
i try to be so free
'cause freedom is the promise
of my destiny
it 's my life
oho ohoho
i 'm never gon na give it up
oho ohoho
i never ever lose my aim
oho ohoho

i would do anything if i could fly
escape into the sky
i 'm feeling like a bird
i would do anything if i could see
the world in harmony
i 'm feeling like a bird
i 'm feeling like a bird
i spread my wings and fly away
i 'm feeling like a bird
i close my eyes my dreams come true for one day
in these days ,
do n't know what 's right or wrong
the world has gone to far
i found a little something to hold on
and then i see a rainbow shining through the clouds
see the birds are flying , they are free no doubt
and imagine it 's me , imagine it 's me
i wish i would have wings
tell me why , this circle never ends
when will we ever learn
all the cultures in this world come to one sense
but then i see the children playing in the street
will they have a future , and enough to eat
and i close my eyes , i close my eyes
i hope my dreams comes true
free , free like a bird
what is this world without love
free , free like a bird
from high above
i 've been down
i have walked on broken ground
you 're the light , you 're my life
we have found one way to drive
oh , when all of my stars have died
you paint them back in the sky
oh , when i 'm dry to my burning bones
you rain on my desert soul
like a river runs through canyons
you 're running through my heart
like an echo sings an anthem
no one will ever keep us apart
like a river runs through canyons
you 're running through my heart
like an echo sings an anthem
no one will ever keep us apart
oh , no one will ever keep us apart
i 've been crushed
i 've been healed
you rebuild my broken shield
you 're the song , you 're my sign
all i know is you 're one of a kind
oh , when all of my stars have died
you paint them back in the sky
oh , when i 'm dry to my burning bones
you rain on my desert soul
like a river runs through canyons
you 're running through my heart
like an echo sings an anthem
no one will ever keep us apart
like a river runs through canyons
you 're running through my heart
like an echo sings an anthem
no one will ever keep us apart
oh , no one will ever keep us apart
gon na shout it from the mountains
oh
gon na shout it from the mountains
oh
like a river runs through canyons
you 're running through my heart
like an echo sings an anthem
no one will ever keep us apart
no one will ever keep us apart
my heart starts boom , my arms feel weak
my head is exploding everyday of the week

baby 's in the parlour
waiting for the rain
beating like a hammer
washing out her pain
clearing like the one
seven years ago
when her first big love
melted like snow
back then she doubet
if she would ever find a man
who could love her that way
the same way again
and just when she thought
she 's living in vain
the man of her dreams
came like the rain
when love is the price
freedom is the cost
love is the price
freedom is the cost
and just when you think
everything is lost
love will be your price
and i know i would not change a thing
yes i know i would n't change a thing
they spoke about her dreams
they spoke about love
they spoke about the things she was so afraid of
he had the key-word
for everything she felt
so it did n't take long
'till he got her nailed
pin one 's hope on someone elses life
and all your dreams
will hurt you like a knife
she soon got lost
when love is the price
freedom is the cost
when love is the price
freedom is the cost
love is the price
freedom is the cost
and just when you think
everything is lost
love will be your prize
and i know i would not change a thing
yes i know i would n't change a thing
she did n't trust that very first man
to come into her life trying to understand
what nobody ever could before
he only made her see
there is something more
to learn about freedom
to learn about love
to handle all the things she was so afraid of
to always follow what she really felt inside
everything else was a rollercoaster ride

when we pray for freedom
so let 's live for the promise land
living in harmony
so let 's live with a helping hand
dreams of a new generation and we pray
what has happened to paradise
in motion or paralyzed
isolation , immigration
frustration all over the nation
we 've been waisting most of our time
talking about things and that 's no sign
recognize the advice
it 's more than only an exercise
remember of the world so far away
where people stay and pray everyday
they have their hopes , they have their chance
to pray for peace and tolerance
remember of past time paradise
a system without any compromise
let me say we can find a way
stand up for the rules and pray
we can make it a better place
when we pray for freedom
it does n't matter what kind of race
when we pray for freedom
so let 's live for the promise land
living in harmony
so let 's live with a helping hand
dreams of a new generation and we pray
pray
pray
what has happened to paradise
is it turned into a world of sorrow and lies
so many people do n't care about rules
honest people seem to be the fools
time to wise up , time to rise up
open your eyes up to the top
hold a dream against the wind
close your eyes and let it in
i 've heard of a world so far away
where people stay and pray everyday
they have no god , no sovereign
they pray for their rules and so they win
remember of past time paradise
to be living in no compromise
let me say we can find a way
stand up for the rules and pray
we can make it a better place
when we pray for freedom
it does n't matter what kind of race
when we pray for freedom
so let 's live for the promise land
living in harmony
so let 's live with a helping hand
dreams of a new generation and we pray
pray
pray
we can make it a better place
when we pray for freedom
it does n't matter what kind of race
when we pray for freedom
so let 's live for the promise land
living in harmony
so let 's live with a helping hand
dreams of a new generation and we pray

shadows of the night
they are coming when the moon is shining bright
leave their graves as shadows of the night
when the city is asleep
no one knows the
shadows of the night
in the darkness they are flying side by side
silent cowls are shadows of the night
no one ever saw a face
of the shadows of the night
cemetery - it 's 1 o'clock
a wolf is howling on a distant rock
it 's time - for the silent slaves
waking up to open their graves
one , two , then three and four
grave by grave more and more
commemoration of transmutation
traces - of a lost generation
the shadows of the night have never died
unsatisfied
they paid the highest price
waiting - for another advice
never found final peace
their restless life will never cease
when the moon is shining bright
they leave their graves as shadows of the night
the shadows of the night are on their flight
never saw the light
silent strangers slow and fast
without future without past
flying through the streets of an endless town
the way to nowhere up and down
people locked the doors of their floors
shadows are fast like a flying horse
a short attack , like a maniac
confused by the ghost in black
when the moon is shining bright
they leave their graves as shadows of the night
listen to the party beat and get in range
'cause you know when i flow and i show you so
which way is better which way you got to go
to make a fun house party all night

somebody dance with me
i 've got this feeling
somebody dance with me
somebody dance with me
another time , another place
another rhyme done for every race
in your case , we 're getting rough
i 'm not going to stop 'till you get enough
'cause you groove back and bobo is back
and you see it yourself , it 's like a heart-attack
my rhymes , combination , infiltration , situation
all over the nation
like round and round , upside down
living my life 'till your feet are on the ground
then put your hands up in the air
and waving like you just do n't care
and if you 're ready to rap , then rap with me
somebody say oh yeah ! ( oh yeah ) oh yeah ( oh yeah ) aaow !

i need you whatever i do
tell me where
where is your love
where is your love
where is your love baby
where is your love honey
where is your love
i need you but maybe it 's too late
to turn back the clock to say i will excuse myself
i 'm here to respect you touch you , feel you
that 's what i want to
you are only temptation
one and one is two i lost the vibration
nine to nine , there 's no sunshine
without you , my life has no colours and no time
i feel so lonely again since you 're gone
i 've been strong
i thought forever that you would be mine
all the time
where is your love
day and night i 'm dreaming of you
and i wish my dream will come true
i need you whatever i do
tell me where
where is your love
day and night i 'm dreaming of you
and i wish my dream will come true
i need you whatever i do
tell me where
where is your love
walking till the end of the road
for now and forever , i 'll share your load
when you 're next to me , i felt so strong
seasons are changing , and now you 're gone
feels long - but it 's the right time
cuts like a knife , inside my mind
this is my sign the real love of my life
get out of my heart i will survive
i cant believe what you 've done to me
now you 're free
how could i fall for someone like you
so untrue
where is your love
day and night i 'm dreaming of you
and i wish my dream will come true
i need you whatever i do
tell me where
where is your love
where is your love
where is your love
where is your love baby
where is your love honey
where is your love
you 're so special - this is the right word
the more i think the deeper it hurts
love - no isolation
think about togetherness is my imagination
temptation , now you 're far away
come back and stay , share my day
heart 's still bleeding mind is outta control
you touch my mind my body and my soul
i feel so lonely again since you 're gone
i 've been strong
i thought forever that you would be mine
all the time
where is your love
day and night i 'm dreaming of you
and i wish my dream will come true
i need you whatever i do
