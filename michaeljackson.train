my jeep began to rock
i did n't know what to do so i stopped and got out
and looked down and noticed i got a flat
so i walked out , parked the car like sideways
so i can find what i can fix
i looked around there were no cars on the highway
i felt a stranged feeling like a mist , so
i walked down towards the end of the road
and in the fog a woman appeared
she said 'do n't you worry my friend i 'll take care
take my hand , i 'll take you there '
( ooo ! )
take me to a place without no name
( no name )
take me to a place without no name
( without no name )
as she took me right through the fog ( ah )
i 've seen a beautiful city appear
of where kids are playin ' and people are laughin '
and are smilin ' and nothin ' to fear
she said this is the place where no people have pain
with love and happiness
she turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin '
and grabbed my hand , 'you 've got a friend '
( woooo ! )
take me to a place without no name
( a place without no name ) ( no name )
take me to a place without no name

take me to a place without no name
( take me ) ( take me ) ( a place without no name )
take me to a place without no name
( a place without ) ( hooo )
( yeah ) ( doggone ) ( hoh )
she started liking me , kissing me and hugging me
she did n't really , really want me to leave
she showed me places i 've never seen and things i 've never done
it really looked like a lot of fun
i 've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
and the flowers surrounded by the trees
this place is filled with love and happiness
i wonder where could i wan na leave
so then i went in my pocket took my wallet all out
with my pictures of my family and girl
this is the place that you choose to be with me
when you thought you could be in another world
( oooh )
take me to a place without no name
( doggone ) ( take me ) ( no name )

i said do n't mind , but what do you mean i am the one
who will dance on the floor in the round
she said i am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
she told me her name was billie jean
as she caused a scene
then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
of being the one
who will dance on the floor in the round
people always told me `` be careful of what you do ''
`` and do n't go around breaking young girls ' hearts ''
and mother always told me `` be careful of who you love
and be careful of what you do , 'cause the lie becomes the truth ''
billie jean is not my lover
she 's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one , but the kid is not my son
for forty days and forty nights
the law was on her side
but who can stand when she 's in demand
her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
so take my strong advice
just remember to always think twice
( do think twice )
she told `` my baby , that 's a threat ''
as she looked at me
then showed a photo of a baby crying
eyes were like mine
go on dance on the floor in the round , baby
people always told me be careful of what you do
and do n't go around breaking young girls ' hearts
she came and stood right by me
then the smell of sweet perfume
this happened much too soon
she called me to her room
billie jean is not my lover
she 's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
billie jean is not my lover
she 's just a girl who claims that i am the one
but the kid is not my son
she says i am the one , but the kid is not my son

i 'm searching for the world that i come from
'cause i 've been looking around
in the lost and found of my heart ...
no one understands me
they view it as such strange eccentricities ...
'cause i keep kidding around
like a child , but pardon me ...
people say i 'm not okay
'cause i love such elementary things ...
it 's been my fate to compensate ,
for the childhood
i 've never known ...
have you seen my childhood ?
i 'm searching for that wonder in my youth
like pirates in adventurous dreams ,
of conquest and kings on the throne ...
before you judge me , try hard to love me ,
look within your heart then ask ,
have you seen my childhood ?
people say i 'm strange that way
'cause i love such elementary things ,
it 's been my fate to compensate ,
for the childhood i 've never known ...
have you seen my childhood ?
i 'm searching for that wonder in my youth
like fantastical stories to share
the dreams i would dare , watch me fly ...
before you judge me , try hard to love me .
the painful youth i 've had
have you seen my childhood ...
oh no
oh no
you 'll never make me stay
so take your weight off of me
i know your every move
so wo n't you just let me be
i 've been here times before
but i was too blind to see
that you seduce every man
this time you wo n't seduce me
she 's saying that 's ok
hey baby do what you please
i have the stuff that you want
i am the thing that you need
she looked me deep in the eyes
she 's touchin me so to start
she says there 's no turnin back
she trapped me in her heart

she likes the boys in the bands
she knows when they come to town
every musician 's fan after
the curtain comes down
she waits at backstage doors
for those who have prestige
who promise
fortune and fame , a life that 's so carefree
she 's saying that 's ok
hey baby do what you want
i 'll be your night lovin thing
i 'll be the freak you can taunt
and i do n't care what you say

dying with the rising of the moon

as i , turn up the collar on
my favorite winter coat
this wind is blowin ' my mind
i see the kids in the street
with not enough to eat
who am i , to be blind ?
pretending not to see their needs
a summer 's disregard
a broken bottle top
and a one man 's soul
they follow each other on
the wind ya ' know
'cause they got nowhere to go
that 's why i want you to know
i 'm starting with the man in the mirror
i 'm asking him to change his ways
and no message could have
been any clearer
if they wan na make the world
a better place
take a look at yourself
and then make a change
( na na na , na na na , na na , na nah )
i 've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
it 's time that i realize
that there are some with no home
not a nickel to loan
could it be really me
pretending that they 're not alone ?
a willow deeply scarred
somebody 's broken heart
and a washed - out dream
( washed - out dream )
they follow the pattern of
the wind , ya ' see
cause they got no place to be
that 's why i 'm starting with me
i 'm starting with the man in the mirror
( ooh ! )

and i do n't know whether to laugh or cry
i do n't know whether to live or die
and it cuts like a knife
she 's out of my life
it 's out of my hands
it 's out of my hands
to think for two years she was here
and i took her for granted i was so cavalier
now the way that it stands
she 's out of my hands
so i 've learned that love 's not possession
and i 've learned that love wo n't wait
now i 've learned that love needs expression
but i learned too late
she 's out of my life
she 's out of my life
damned indecision and cursed pride
kept my love for her locked deep inside
and it cuts like a knife
she 's out of my life

i 'm just an average man with an average life
i work from nine to five , hey , hell , i pay the price
all i want is to be left alone in my average home
but why do i always feel like i 'm in the twilight zone ?
and
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
tell me is it just a dream ?
when i come home at night
i bolt the door real tight
people call me on the phone , i 'm trying to avoid
but can the people on tv see me or am i just paranoid ?
when i 'm in the shower , i 'm afraid to wash my hair
Ã¢â¬ cause i might open my eyes and find someone standing there
people say i 'm crazy , just a little touched
but maybe showers remind me of psycho too much
that 's why
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
who 's playing tricks on me ?
( who 's watching me ? )
i do n't know anymore
are the neighbors watching me ?
( who 's watching ? )
well is the mailman watching me ?
( tell me who 's watching ? )
and i do n't feel safe anymore , oh what a mess
i wonder who 's watching me now
( who ? ! )
the irs ? !
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
tell me , is it just a dream ?
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
and i have no privacy
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
who 's playing tricks on me ?
( who 's watching ? )
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
tell me , who can it be ?
( who 's watching ? )
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
who 's playing tricks on me ?
( who 's watching me ? )
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
can i have my privacy ?
i always feel like somebody 's watching me
who 's playing tricks on me ?

you are my friend

like you are my brother
love me like a mother
will you be there ?

tell me will you hold me
when wrong , will you scold me
when lost will you find me ?
but they told me
a man should be faithful
and walk when not able
and fight till the end
but i 'm only human
everyone 's taking control of me
seems that the world 's
got a role for me
i 'm so confused
will you show to me
you 'll be there for me
and care enough to bear me
( hold me )
( lay your head lowly )
( softly then boldly )
( carry me there )
( lead me )
( love me and feed me )
( kiss me and free me )
( i will feel blessed )
( carry )
( carry me boldly )
( lift me up slowly )
( carry me there )
( save me )
( heal me and bathe me )
( softly you say to me )
( i will be there )
( lift me )
( lift me up slowly )
( carry me boldly )
( show me you care )
( hold me )
( lay your head lowly )
( softly then boldly )

[ spoken : ]
in our darkest hour
in my deepest despair
will you still care ?
will you be there ?
in my trials
and my tribulations
through our doubts
and frustrations
in my violence
in my turbulence
through my fear
and my confessions
in my anguish and my pain
through my joy and my sorrow
in the promise of another tomorrow
